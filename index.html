                    <article class="about_me_article">
                        I was born on November 13th, 1996 in Bosnia and Herzegovina and have a diverse background in
                        various
                        roles that have
                        allowed me to develop key skills and qualities that are valuable in a web development position.
                        My
                        extensive experience
                        working with people has honed my communication skills and ability to work effectively in a team.
                        Additionally, I have
                        excellent computer skills, including proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java,
                        and web
                        development
                        technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, NODE.js, and REST. I am highly disciplined,
                        having
                        developed this
                        trait through years of diverse work experience, and fluent in German (C1 level), English (native
                        level),
                        and
                        Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian (native level).

                        My work experience ranges from roles in the food and retail industries to positions in customer
                        service
                        and event
                        management. My most recent experience at Doppler Mineralöle Gmbh as a gas station attendant and
                        salesperson, along with
                        my previous role as a cook at McDonald’s, has taught me how to work in fast-paced environments
                        and
                        provide excellent
                        customer service. My experience at Shell and FITINN GmbH has further developed my ability to
                        work in a
                        team and handle
                        responsibilities effectively. My time at ManpowerGroup GmbH as a service employee and at
                        Eventservice
                        Parkas GmbH as an
                        event coordinator has honed my customer service and problem-solving skills.

                        I am currently completing my Bachelor's degree in Software & Information Engineering at TU Wien,
                        where I
                        am learning the
                        latest web development technologies and techniques. These experiences and skills make me a
                        strong
                        candidate for a web
                        developer position and I am eager to bring my talents to a dynamic and innovative company.

                <h2>Front_End</h2>

                <article>
                    As a web developer, I have a solid understanding of front-end technologies.
                    I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript, which are essential to creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. I am also
                    proficient in using
                    Bootstrap, a popular framework for creating responsive and mobile-friendly web pages. These skills
                    allow
                    me to design
                    and build websites that not only look great, but are also easy to navigate and provide a seamless
                    user
                    experience.

                <h2>Back_End</h2>

                <article>
                    In addition to my front-end skills, I am well-versed in back-end development
                    technologies. I have experience using
                    NODE.js, a popular platform for building server-side applications, and am familiar with REST, a
                    protocol
                    for
                    transmitting data over the web. These skills enable me to build websites that are not only visually
                    appealing, but also
                    efficient and secure, ensuring that users can access the information they need quickly and securely.

                <h2>Programming_Languages</h2>

                <article>
                    I have a strong foundation in programming languages such as Java and Python.
                    Java is a popular language for building
                    large-scale applications and is commonly used in the development of mobile and desktop software.
                    Python,
                    on the other
                    hand, is a versatile language that is widely used in data science, machine learning, and web
                    development. My proficiency
                    in these languages allows me to write clean and efficient code, which is essential for creating
                    stable
                    and reliable
                    applications.
