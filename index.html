                I was born on November 13th, 1996 in Bosnia and Herzegovina and
                have a diverse background in various roles that have allowed me
                to develop key skills and qualities that are valuable in a web
                development position. My extensive experience working with
                people has honed my communication skills and ability to work
                effectively in a team. Additionally, I have excellent computer
                skills, including proficiency in programming languages such as
                Python, Java, and web development technologies like HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript, Bootstrap, NODE.js, and REST. I am highly
                disciplined, having developed this trait through years of
                diverse work experience, and fluent in German (C1 level),
                English (native level), and Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian (native
                level). My work experience ranges from roles in the food and
                retail industries to positions in customer service and event
                management. My most recent experience at Doppler Mineralöle Gmbh
                as a gas station attendant and salesperson, along with my
                previous role as a cook at McDonald’s, has taught me how to work
                in fast-paced environments and provide excellent customer
                service. My experience at Shell and FITINN GmbH has further
                developed my ability to work in a team and handle
                responsibilities effectively. My time at ManpowerGroup GmbH as a
                service employee and at Eventservice Parkas GmbH as an event
                coordinator has honed my customer service and problem-solving
                skills. I am currently completing my Bachelor's degree in
                Software & Information Engineering at TU Wien, where I am
                learning the latest web development technologies and techniques.
                These experiences and skills make me a strong candidate for a
                web developer position and I am eager to bring my talents to a
                dynamic and innovative company.

              <h2>Front_End</h2>

              <article>
                As a web developer, I have a solid understanding of front-end
                technologies. I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript, which are essential to creating visually appealing
                and user-friendly websites. I am also proficient in using
                Bootstrap, a popular framework for creating responsive and
                mobile-friendly web pages. These skills allow me to design and
                build websites that not only look great, but are also easy to
                navigate and provide a seamless user experience.

              <h2>Back_End</h2>

              <article>
                In addition to my front-end skills, I am well-versed in back-end
                development technologies. I have experience using NODE.js, a
                popular platform for building server-side applications, and am
                familiar with REST, a protocol for transmitting data over the
                web. These skills enable me to build websites that are not only
                visually appealing, but also efficient and secure, ensuring that
                users can access the information they need quickly and securely.

              <h2>Programming_Languages</h2>

              <article>
                I have a strong foundation in programming languages such as Java
                and Python. Java is a popular language for building large-scale
                applications and is commonly used in the development of mobile
                and desktop software. Python, on the other hand, is a versatile
                language that is widely used in data science, machine learning,
                and web development. My proficiency in these languages allows me
                to write clean and efficient code, which is essential for
                creating stable and reliable applications.
